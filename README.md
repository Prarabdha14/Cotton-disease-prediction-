Key Features:

Transfer Learning: Leverages pre-trained models (InceptionV3 and ResNet50) trained on ImageNet for efficient feature extraction.

Data Preprocessing: Includes image loading, resizing, augmentation (e.g., rotation, flipping, zooming), and data splitting.

Model Fine-tuning: Fine-tunes the pre-trained models on the cotton disease dataset by retraining the top layers.

Model Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

Visualization: Visualizes model predictions and feature maps to gain insights into the model's decision-making process.
