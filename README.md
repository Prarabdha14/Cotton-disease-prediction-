# Cotton-disease-prediction-
This repository explores the prediction of cotton diseases using deep learning models with transfer learning. Two popular convolutional neural network architectures, InceptionV3 and ResNet50, are employed and fine-tuned on a dataset of cotton leaf images with disease labels.
